# EvolutionaryComputationTSP
Here you'll find a small python program for finding a good solution to a TSP problem with evolutionary computation. It has been written for the  Computation Thinking course at the Amsterdam University College in 2017.

As input to the program you can provide a file with points in a 2D space according to the .tsp format.
Alternatively edit the distance matrix in the GeneticTSP file
